This was made to be integrated on the windows context menu for a quick execution.<br/>
The name of the files follow the following model: `@folder-name[number]`: <br/>

-   <b>folder-name</b> - name of the folder where the application was executed.<br/>
-   <b>number</b> - counted on the application starting with 1.

The application was made for folders that the files have the same type:

- Video Extensions = [.mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .flv, .webm, .mpeg, .mpg, .3gp];
- Audio Extensions = [.mp3, .wav, .ogg, .flac, .aac, .wma, .m4a, .ape, .opus, .pcm];
